# Lapis

LuaCATS annotations for [Lapis](https://leafo.net/lapis/).

## Disclaimer

These definitions only include functions that are publicly documented. Any
functions not publicly documented are excluded from these types.

[Input validation] is not implemented due to heavy reliance on generics which are
still a [work in progress].

Some comments might be out of date due to changing documentation in Lapis.
